# c-hello-module
A basic C project to test modules and my Makefile.

Based on this YouTube Tutorial
https://youtu.be/8KyZedtkEhk

And this Makefile
https://www.cs.colby.edu/maxwell/courses/tutorials/maketutor/

To build + run open a terminal and type:
```
make
```

After that completes to run again without compiling type:
```
make run
```

The Exe / Appimage builds to the "app" folder
